# Singularity

Singularity is a VS Code extension that helps developers 
truly understand their code - not just ship it.

When you accept AI-generated code, Singularity asks you 
one simple question about it to verify you understand 
what you just accepted. When you write your own code, 
it asks you to reason through your decisions.

Over time, it builds an honest map of what you truly 
understand versus what you've been blindly accepting.
